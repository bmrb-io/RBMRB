# RBMRB
[BMRB](http://www.bmrb.io) collects, annotates, archives, and disseminates (worldwide in the public domain) the important spectral and quantitative data derived from NMR spectroscopic investigations of biological macromolecules and metabolites. The goal is to empower scientists in their analysis of the structure, dynamics, and chemistry of biological systems and to support further development of the field of biomolecular NMR spectroscopy

RBMRB is a R package to fetch NMR chemical shift data directly from BMRB into R environment as a data frame in R. This facilitates access to BMRB data for statistical analysis and data visualization. It is using the [BMRB-API](https://github.com/uwbmrb/BMRB-API) to fetch the data from BMRB database. In addition to the data access, a minimal set to data visualization tools are also available with this package.
